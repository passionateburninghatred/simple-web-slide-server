# how to use :
<pre>install express and fs
edit config.json with all ur url and port and stuff its pretty self explanatory if u open it
edit pages.json with all ur pages (dont add / at the end of the url or it wont work.)
upload all your slide files to the /rawFiles/raw/ folder with a prefix and number. ie: example1.png,example2.png,example3.png
add this code: {SLIDES:(SLIDE FILE PREFIX),(AMOUNT OF SLIDES),(SLIDE FILE TYPE)}
(you can see an example of what the html file should look like in /rawFiles/ipaddress.htm)
run it</pre>
